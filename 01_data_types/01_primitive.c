  *** There are 3 typs of data are available in C and C++ ***
    
     1] Primitive Data-Types :- The data which is provided by the lanuguage creator (ABOVE PROGRAM IS THE EX OF PRIMTITVE DATA TYPE)

     2] Derived Data Types :+ The data type which is derived from anyb existing data type (ARRAY,POINTER,FUNCTION)

     3] User Defined Data Types :- The data type which created by the user according to his requirments
